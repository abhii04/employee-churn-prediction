# Employee Turnover Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, or churn, is a critical issue for organizations as it impacts productivity and morale. By predicting turnover, companies can proactively take steps to retain valuable employees.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It includes various attributes that can influence turnover such as:
- Satisfaction Level
- Evaluation Scores
- Number of Projects
- Average Monthly Hours
- Years at the Company
- Work Accidents
- Promotions in the Last 5 Years
- Department
- Salary Level

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company (turnover prediction). This helps in identifying factors that contribute to turnover and developing strategies to mitigate it.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding)
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing distributions of features
   - Correlation analysis
   - Identifying relationships between features and turnover

3. **Model Building:**
   - Utilizing various machine learning algorithms:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Neural Network

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC-AUC Curve and Score

## Results
- Detailed evaluation results for each model:
  - Confusion matrices
  - Classification reports
  - ROC-AUC scores

## Conclusion
- Insights gained from the project
- Recommendations for reducing turnover based on model findings
- Future directions (e.g., incorporating more data sources, continuous model updating)
